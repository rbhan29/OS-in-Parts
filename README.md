Operating System Assignments

Tech Stack: C language, Linux

Itâ€™s a compilation of operating system and systems programming assignments, which includes implementation of process schedulers, custom shell, memory management (segmentation, paging, two-level page tables), multithreading, and parallel sorting in C.

This project acts as an implementation of theoretical concepts studied in OS like process management, scheduling algorithms, inter-process communication (signals, pipes), thread synchronization using mutexes and semaphores, and deadlock avoidance techniques.
